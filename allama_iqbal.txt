Allama Muhammad Iqbal, born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot (present-day Pakistan), was a renowned philosopher,

poet, and politician in British India who is widely regarded as the spiritual father of Pakistan.

His poetry, written in Urdu and Persian, carried deep philosophical and spiritual meaning, urging Muslims to rediscover their identity and potential in the modern world.

Iqbal's works, like Bang-e-Dra and Bal-e-Jibril, reflect themes of self-awareness, unity, and the revival of Islamic values.

He is often called “Mufakkir-e-Pakistan” (The Thinker of Pakistan) for his vision of a separate homeland for Muslims, which later materialized as Pakistan.

His famous 1930 speech at the Allahabad Address laid the intellectual foundation for the idea of Pakistan, advocating for the political autonomy of Muslim-majority provinces.

Beyond his literary contributions, Iqbal was a philosopher who explored complex ideas such as selfhood (khudi),

the unity of being, and the relationship between God and man. His thoughts combined elements of Islamic mysticism, Western philosophy, and Eastern tradition, making him a bridge between different intellectual worlds.
